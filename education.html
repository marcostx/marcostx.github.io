      <h4>Research Focus: Deep Learning</h4>
      <p>My master's thesis focused on violence detection in videos, where I studied how attention-based methods - well
        known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task compared with many other methods in quantitative
        and qualitative analysis.</p>

      <p>This research contributed to understanding the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in video analysis,
        particularly for detecting violent content, which has applications in content moderation and security systems.
