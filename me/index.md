# Marcos Vinícius

## Senior Machine Learning Engineer | AI Engineer @ Nubank

I'm Marcos, a writer, a passionate reader, and a computer scientist. I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer focused on building ML platform products. At Nubank, my engineer role centers on elevating credit card operational platforms through the creation of efficient frameworks, ensuring both reliability and scalability.

### What I Do

The journey with my global team has led to significant improvements in the deployment of innovative policies and models, ultimately enhancing our operational efficiency. My tenure at Nubank has been marked by leadership in transforming monolithic applications into modular systems, which has drastically optimized costs and improved platform dependability.

I also contributed to support for scale and deploying critical large ML models into production. These efforts reflect my commitment to scalable ML system solutions that support the organization's strategic objectives.

### Background

In my past experiences, I've also worked as a Data Scientist building models to generate business impacts for fields like water management, network analysis, and fuel/retail demand.

I have a master's in Computer Science focused on Deep Learning. My theme was violence detection in videos in which I studied how attention-based methods - well known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task compared with many other methods in quantitative and qualitative analysis.

### Personal Interests

In my free time, I love to travel and read books.

### Key Achievements at Nubank

* Development of AI Agents to provide personalized financial insights to customers in the AI Private Banker product
* Led critical system decoupling from monolithic applications to smaller and modular applications
* Modernized model calibration framework enhancing analyst/data scientist collaboration
* Deployed catalog framework improving credit policy governance and lifecycle
* Led several heavy dataset optimizations and migrations to new data mesh infrastructure
