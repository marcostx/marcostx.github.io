    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Marcos, a writer, a passionate reader, and a computer scientist. I currently work as a Machine Learning
      Engineer focused on building ML platform products. At Nubank, my engineer role centers on elevating credit card
      operational platforms through the creation of efficient frameworks, ensuring both reliability and scalability.</p>

    <p>The journey with my global team has led to significant improvements in the deployment of innovative policies and
      models, ultimately enhancing our operational efficiency. My tenure at Nubank has been marked by leadership in
      transforming monolithic applications into modular systems, which has drastically optimized costs and improved
      platform dependability.</p>

    <p>In my past experiences, I've also worked as a Data Scientist building models to generate business impacts for
      fields like water management, network analysis, and fuel/retail demand.</p>

    <p>I have a master's in Computer Science focused on Deep Learning. My theme was violence detection in videos in
      which I studied how attention-based methods - well known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task
      compared with many other methods in quantitative and qualitative analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>In my free time, I love to travel and read books.</strong></p>
