## Academic Education

### Master's Degree in Computer Science
**Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)**  
**2017 - 2020**

My master's thesis focused on **violence detection in videos**, where I studied how attention-based methods - well known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task compared with many other methods in quantitative and qualitative analysis.

This research contributed to understanding the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in video analysis, particularly for detecting violent content, which has applications in content moderation and security systems.

#### Research Focus: Deep Learning
The research explored the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing techniques, specifically:

* **Attention-based methods** for video understanding
* **Transformer architectures** applied to video analysis
* **Quantitative and qualitative analysis** of different approaches
* **Violence detection** as a practical application of deep learning

### Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
**Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS)**  
**2014 - 2017**

## Publications

### "What should we pay attention to when classifying violent videos?"
Research publication focusing on attention mechanisms in video classification, specifically for violence detection. This work explores the effectiveness of different attention-based approaches and their interpretability in understanding what visual features are most important for classification decisions.

### "Sistema baseado em Aprendizado de Máquina para Reconhecimento de Entidades Nomeadas em Português"
*(Machine Learning-Based System for Recognition of Named Entities in Portuguese)*

The internet is a vast repository of information, and most of this data is text. Computer systems are widely used today for data analysis and are very efficient at processing structured data. However, human, or natural, language is very complex and lacks the structure necessary for efficient computer processing. The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) [1] deals with the development of algorithms to identify the information presented in a text and represent it in a structured format that is suitable for computational processing. In this way, other systems already used in data analysis can be applied to the information available in natural language. An essential task in NLP is Named Entity Recognition (NER) [2]. Named entities are references to real-world entities, such as people, places, or institutions, through mentions of names or acronyms that identify these entities. Currently, the field of Machine Learning (ML) provides the most effective tools for NLP.

This project consists of developing a system to capture documents from the Internet, store them, and index them according to named entities recognized by machine learning algorithms. The system also includes functionalities for reviewing the entities recognized by the machine learning algorithms in order to evaluate the performance of these algorithms.

## Research Impact

My academic work has contributed to two important areas:

1. **Computer Vision**: Advancing the understanding of attention mechanisms in video analysis
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Improving named entity recognition for Portuguese language

The intersection of these fields has informed my professional work, particularly in developing AI systems that can understand and process both visual and textual information effectively.
