## Academic Education

### Master's Degree in Computer Science
**Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP)**  
**2017 - 2020**

My master's thesis focused on **violence detection in videos**, where I studied how attention-based methods - well known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task compared with many other methods in quantitative and qualitative analysis.

This research contributed to understanding the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in video analysis, particularly for detecting violent content, which has applications in content moderation and security systems.

#### Research Focus: Deep Learning
The research explored the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing techniques, specifically:

* **Attention-based methods** for video understanding
* **Transformer architectures** applied to video analysis
* **Quantitative and qualitative analysis** of different approaches
* **Violence detection** as a practical application of deep learning

### Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science
**Universidade Federal de Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS)**  
**2014 - 2017**

Comprehensive foundation in computer science fundamentals, including algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and early exposure to machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts.

## Publications

### "What should we pay attention to when classifying violent videos?"
Research publication focusing on attention mechanisms in video classification, specifically for violence detection. This work explores the effectiveness of different attention-based approaches and their interpretability in understanding what visual features are most important for classification decisions.

### "Sistema baseado em Aprendizado de M√°quina para Reconhecimento de Entidades Nomeadas em Portugu√™s"
*(Machine Learning-Based System for Recognition of Named Entities in Portuguese)*

Research on Natural Language Processing for Portuguese language, focusing on Named Entity Recognition using machine learning approaches. This work contributed to advancing NLP capabilities for Portuguese text processing.

## Honors & Awards

### üèÜ 4th Place Brazilian Robotics Competition
**IEEE Very Small Size (CBR 2012)**  
Recognition for excellence in robotics competition, demonstrating skills in autonomous systems, programming, and engineering problem-solving.

### üèÖ Best Scientific Poster
**Graduation Category**  
"Machine Learning-Based System for Recognition of Named Entities in Portuguese"  
Award for outstanding research presentation and contribution to the field of Natural Language Processing.

## Certifications

* **Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization**
* **Machine Learning Data Lifecycle in Production**
* **XII Workshop de Vis√£o Computacional (WVC 2016)**
* **IV Workshop de Engenharia de Software**
* **Escola Regional de Inform√°tica**

## Research Impact

My academic work has contributed to two important areas:

1. **Computer Vision**: Advancing the understanding of attention mechanisms in video analysis
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Improving named entity recognition for Portuguese language

The intersection of these fields has informed my professional work, particularly in developing AI systems that can understand and process both visual and textual information effectively.
