### Machine Learning Engineer
**July 2022 - August 2023 (1 year 2 months)**
*São Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil*

During this period, I focused on building the foundation for the ML platform products that would later become central to our operations. This role prepared me for the senior position where I could lead larger initiatives and architectural decisions.

## Impact at Nubank

My work at Nubank has been centered around creating scalable, reliable ML systems that support the company's strategic objectives. The transformation from monolithic to modular systems has been particularly impactful, resulting in significant cost optimizations and improved platform dependability.

The AI Private Banker product, featuring AI Agents that provide personalized financial insights, represents a significant step forward in how financial institutions can leverage AI to enhance customer experience while maintaining the reliability and security standards required in the fintech industry.
