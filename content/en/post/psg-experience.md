## PsG Tecnologia Aplicada

### Software Engineer Intern
**August 2013 - August 2014 (1 year 1 month)**
*Campo Grande e Regi√£o, Brasil*

My first professional experience in technology was at PsG Tecnologia Aplicada, where I worked on an innovative agricultural technology project that combined artificial intelligence, computer vision, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to solve real-world farming challenges.

## Project Overview: Sugarcane Plantation Flaw Detection

### The Challenge

One of the critical factors that directly impacts sugarcane production is the presence of "flaws" in the sugarcane lines. These flaws are characterized by regions where the distance between two consecutive sugarcane stalks is greater than 50 cm. Detecting these flaws presents a significant challenge given:

* **Scale**: The enormous size of sugarcane plantations
* **Traditional Methods**: Current methodology relies on manual inspection, requiring people to walk through plantations and manually measure distances
* **Efficiency**: Manual data collection is time-consuming, expensive, and potentially unsafe

### The Solution: AI-Powered Aerial Analysis

With technological advancement, it became possible to obtain high-resolution area images using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This breakthrough enabled us to estimate failure rates in plantations in a faster, safer, and more economical way.

#### My Role & Contributions:

* **Algorithm Development**: Developed algorithms in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision for processing aerial images to detect plantation flaws

* **Image Processing**: Created sophisticated image processing pipelines to analyze high-resolution UAV imagery and identify spacing irregularities in sugarcane rows

* **Pattern Recognition**: Implemented pattern recognition systems to automatically detect and measure distances between sugarcane stalks

* **Agricultural Innovation**: Contributed to pioneering work in precision agriculture, helping to modernize traditional farming practices

## Technical Skills Developed

This project provided my first exposure to several key technologies that would shape my career:

* **Computer Vision**: Fundamental understanding of image processing and analysis techniques
* **Artificial Intelligence**: Early exposure to AI algorithms for practical problem-solving
* **Agricultural Technology**: Understanding of how technology can transform traditional industries
* **Remote Sensing**: Experience with UAV imagery and aerial data analysis
* **Algorithm Development**: Skills in developing custom algorithms for specific domain problems

## Impact & Innovation

This project was groundbreaking in several ways:

* **Industry Transformation**: Helped modernize agricultural practices by introducing automated monitoring systems
* **Cost Reduction**: Significantly reduced the cost and time required for plantation monitoring
* **Safety Improvement**: Eliminated the need for manual inspection in potentially hazardous plantation environments
* **Precision Agriculture**: Contributed to the early development of precision agriculture techniques in Brazil

## Career Foundation

This experience was instrumental in shaping my career trajectory toward AI and machine learning. Working on a real-world application of computer vision and artificial intelligence in my first professional role:

* Sparked my passion for applying AI to solve practical problems
* Provided early exposure to the intersection of technology and traditional industries
* Taught me the value of innovative thinking in addressing complex challenges
* Established my interest in developing algorithms that have measurable real-world impact

The project at PsG Tecnologia Aplicada laid the groundwork for my subsequent focus on machine learning and AI, demonstrating how these technologies could transform industries and solve meaningful problems.
