## Hello World

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer | AI Engineer @ Nubank**

I'm Marcos, a writer, a passionate reader, and a computer scientist. I currently work as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer on a global team at Nubank, building AI capabilities for the AI Private Banker and creating platforms to serve teams across the company.

My work involves the continuous evolution and enhancement of AI platforms critical to our AI Private Banker products. I design, implement, and maintain an AI Platform for Agents and tools that boost product teams with AI capabilities. Key achievements include deploying conversational AI agents for debt renegotiation & investment support, launching LLM-powered proactive financial health recommendations, re-architecting ML models managing $3B monthly credit exposure, and leading system modernization initiatives that decoupled monolithic systems into modular architecture.

In my past experiences, I've also worked as a Data Scientist building models to generate business impacts for fields like water management, network analysis, and fuel/retail demand.

I have a master's in Computer Science focused on Deep Learning. My theme was violence detection in videos in which I studied how attention-based methods - well known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task compared with many other methods in quantitative and qualitative analysis.

In my free time, I love to travel and read books.
