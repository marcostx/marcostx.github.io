## Hello World

**Senior Machine Learning Engineer | AI Engineer @ Nubank**

I'm Marcos, a writer, a passionate reader, and a computer scientist. I currently work as a Machine Learning Engineer on a frontline team building all the intelligence and AI capabilities to power the future AI Private Banker and turning this into a platform to serve many teams within the company. 

Additionally, I'm designing and building the platform for the AI Private Banker, which will serve product teams to enable scaling of agentic solutions across different product fronts. I also lead the development of an Investments AI Agent focused on answering key questions about customer portfolios in natural language, elevating the way customers interact with their investments.

In my past experiences, I've also worked as a Data Scientist building models to generate business impacts for fields like water management, network analysis, and fuel/retail demand.

I have a master's in Computer Science focused on Deep Learning. My theme was violence detection in videos in which I studied how attention-based methods - well known after the boom of Transformers - performed for this task compared with many other methods in quantitative and qualitative analysis.

In my free time, I love to travel and read books.
