Working on the first horizontal ML platform team at Raízen, I have been at
the forefront of enhancing our data pipelines and establishing a cohesive
framework for model monitoring. My responsibilities include:

- Collaboratively framing strategies for horizontal improvement of data pipeline
infrastructure, ensuring seamless data flows and accessibility across multiple
teams within the organization.


- Led the initial work to standardize model monitoring practices, which has
enabled consistent model performance tracking and has laid the groundwork
for unified anomaly detection and health metrics.

As the Lead Data Scientist, I conducted two critical time series forecasting
projects to enhance fuel product demand predictions. I focused on delivering
organizational and performance improvements through:

- Streamlining and cleaning code, reducing complexity for better
maintainability.
- Parallelizing and optimizing backtest and predicting workflows, increasing
computational efficiency.
- Modularizing code structures to improve the scalability of forecasting models.

Key achievements include designing advanced model refinement strategies
to boost forecast accuracy, implementing monitoring pipelines for continual
model performance assessment, and pioneering a user-friendly forecasting
simulator. This simulator empowers business stakeholders to explore and
understand model predictions, fostering a deeper engagement with our data-
driven initiatives.

One of the points that directly impact the production of sugarcane and
the presence of "flaws" in the sugarcane lines. The flaws in this work are
characterized by regions where the distance between two consecutive rods is
greater than 50 cm. Detect flaws and a great challenge given the size of the
plantations and the methodology currently employed. Currently, data collection
for fault estimation is done by displacing people within the plantation and that
of manual measurement. With technological advancement, it is possible to
obtain high resolution area images using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. With
these images it is possible to estimate the failure rate in the plantations in a
faster, safer and more economical way. The objective of this project was the


development of algorithms in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision for
the treatment of the images for the estimation of the failures from the aerial
images.
